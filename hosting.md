GDS follows the [Government Cloud First policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) meaning that we prefer the use of PaaS and IaaS solutions over managing our own hardware

## User Needs

* Users want systems that are highly scalable and available
* GDS wants to manage the environments easily and simply, with confidence via automated tools

## Principles

GDS will build new tools on only one cloud platform for each of IaaS and PaaS.

We prefer systems built on a PaaS to systems built on IaaS where possible.

We prefer cloud suppliers that are well supported by common tooling to reduce cost of migrating to a new supplier.

## Tools

GDS has selected two cloud platforms:

### PaaS

* GOV.UK PaaS

### IaaS

* Amazon Web Services
